# Contact-Form-7-Summary-and-Print
This plugin helps you to view the summary of contact form 7 form with a print summary button. Users can view their form’s summary of all the fields which they have entered during form submission or you can add your custom message on a summary page with the Print button at the bottom so they can easily print out their form summary.  Once you install the plugin you can see a new tab “Summary &amp; Print” added to your edit form window. Go to the tab and make your setting and save it.  In case if you only want to show the summary and don’t want to show the Print button at the summary page, then you can leave the Print button’s field empty. When you leave it empty the Print button will not show up.
